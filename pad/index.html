                        <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those
                            related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.</li>
                        <li>Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of "dead" or rejected

                        <li>Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as

                        <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
                        <li>Jokes that resemble the above, such as "hipster racism", still count as harassment even
                            if meant satirically or ironically.</li>

                        Reporting
                    </h3>

                    <p>If you are being harassed by a member of our community, notice that someone else is being
                        harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the moderators via the Pawper's Pad Discord
                        (you can tag @mods). If the person who is harassing you is on the mods team, they will not be
                        involved in handling or resolving the incident.</p>

                    <p>The mods team will respond to any complaint as promptly as possible we can. If you do not
                        get a timely response (for example, if no mods are currently online) then please put your
                        personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting one of the mods
                        by direct message. The moderators will follow-up with you within 24 hours.</p>

                    <p>This code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you are being harassed by a
                        member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all
                        good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the moderators, seriously.
                        This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in
                        time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the community based on their
                        past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior towards people who are
                        not in this community.</p>

                    <p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any
                        report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate
                        criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

                    <h3 id="enforcement-process">
                        Enforcement Process
                    </h3>

                    <p>Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care. If a
                        member's immediate safety and security is threatened, an individual mod may take any
                        action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from
                        the community. In less urgent situations, at least two moderators will discuss the offense and
                        mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with the offender privately.
                        Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, the decision of the moderators involved in a
                        violation case will be considered final.</p>

                    <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At
                        our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment
                        complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will
                        increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not name harassment
                        victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

                        Consequences
                    </h3>

                    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a
                        participant engages in harassing behavior, the moderators may take any action they deem
                        appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and identification of the
                        participant as a harasser to other members. At the discretion of the mods, or by request,
                        one or more of the parties involved may request to discuss the violation and how to avoid
                        similar situations in the future.</p>
